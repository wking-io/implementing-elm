description: 'Introduction to the Implementing Elm podcast. A podcast about the Elm development language.'
episode: '23a393f1'

The reason for the this podcast is straightforward, to help Elm developers get better together by listening to real implementation stories from the people who have done the work. Elm as a language and the community are young and the amount of resources and examples from teams or individuals covering the details of implementing an Elm codebase could be better, and that is what I want to help with.

### Why do I think this is important?

Well, because this is what I wish I had right now. Elm has come along way from the idea of centering rectangles on a screen and the community has grown right along with it. But, the language and the community is still young. Especially in comparison to other languages like JavaScript and Python. I'm not saying being a young community is bad but there is a cause and effect that comes with it.

Because Elm and the community are young the amount of resources and examples from teams and individuals in the community could be better, and that is what I want to help with.
