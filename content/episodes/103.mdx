This episode covers how Jim brought LaTex and markdown together into a single editor on the web using the elm parser. The secret sauce??? Community and finding help from those around you. We do not always have to have the right answers ourselves to every engineering problem. Other perspectives can help approach a problem in a new way that gets the job done not only sooner but a lot of times better as well.
