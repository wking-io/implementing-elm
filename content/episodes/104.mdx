Although elm-ui may be what he is most known for publicly its not why I am talking to Matthew. Matthew has also created elm-markup. A custom markup syntax for Elm. It gives you the power of the Elm compiler and types that you can apply to a completely custom syntax that you define. Today he and I sit down to talk about how he achieved that and how it he built the editor example he used to show it off at Oslo Elm Day.
